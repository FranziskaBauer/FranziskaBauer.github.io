    <div class="AboutMe-text">
      <p class="AboutMe-text-p1">From early childhood on I have been passionate about fine arts and have been engaging in several of its forms such as drawing, painting, sculpturing, and photography. My academic training as a biologist made me discover a gigantic diversity of shapes, colours, and functions in the natural world at which I am looking in awe even after all these years. Now many people ask me why I decided to quit my job as a biologist to become a designer if I had such a deep passion for the natural world. Their question is legitimate. Because at first glance, biology and the design field could not be more disparate. But the truth is that both professions require the same skills set to discover the unseen and the unthought.</p>
      <p>I decided to become a designer precisely because this profession is so different from that of a biologist at first, but in principle so similar in how both professions approach their subjects: with both a curious and an analytical eye. This intersection between the creative freedom of a designer and the scientificity of a biologist is what I find particularly fascinating and very worthy of pursuing in my career. Thus, quitting my career as a biologist did not make me become an “ex-biologist”, but rather a “biologist + designer“ who is using her deep knowledge of the natural world as a fruitful and unceasing source of inspiration to be drained into all fields of design, from design thinking to visual communication. What interests me as a “biologist+designer“ is the human mind – how it is build, how it responds to external and internal influences, what it is able to create and to which degree it can adapt to modern-day life and its benefits and challenges.</p>
      <p>One mission I have as a “biologist + designer“ is to make people aware of the biological diversity around us, to its beauty and of the threads that we pose to its, and eventually to our own survival.</p>
